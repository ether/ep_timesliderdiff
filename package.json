Nice UI makes unicorns sing carols of passion to flop.\n\nInstall via the /admin/plugins UI in Etherpad Lite.\n\n# TODO\n\n* Lots...\n* Authentication (SocketIO would fix this)\n* Use SocketIO instead of AJAX (for streaming when searching through large pads)\n* Minimize heavy lifting for large pads (by using diffs instead of entire pad context when doing regex)\n* UI polishing\n* Progress indicator\n",
